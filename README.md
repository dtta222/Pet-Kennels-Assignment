# Pet-Kennels-Assignment

A large dog kennel has four crates used to transport pet animals across small distances in an animal shelter. 
Each crate can accommodate one dog. The fourth crate cannot be used because it needs to be used for storage 
purposes. So only THREE dogs can be accommodated per Kennel

Purpose: Develop a Java application where you will help accommodate and place three dogs in a large Kennel 
in their own big crate. A program is needed which can take in the data of the dogs and assign them to an 
available crate in the Kennel in a specific order and print the details of the Kennel and the dogs assigned 
to the crate once all the crates have been filled.
